# foodhat
Creating foodhat using node.js, express, angular, and socket.io

## I will essentially be rewriting this application because it is a mess right now.
**Context: I wrote this application prior to working professionally and knowing what good software looks like**
- Will refactor heavily
   - Use SOLID principles where applicable
   - Make code more readable
- I will switch from firestore to MongoDB
- I will add Redis to add scalability to Socket.IO to work with load-balancing
- Will use OOP principles and use typecast in Angular code.
